- Ex. 1. Write a program that greets a person,
where the name of the person is read from the
keyboard.

- Ex. 2. Write a program that reads four numbers (a,
b, c, d) and computes the result of a +b * c + d.
- Hint:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    a = input("a = ")
    b = input("b= ")
    multRes = int(a) * float(b)
    print(multRes)

- Ex. 3. Consider the previous example, but this time you have to
use methods and the numbers should have the values less
than 10.
Hint:
if __name__== "__main__":
    def compute(a, b):
        if a > 10:
            Print(“a is too big")
        elif a <= 10:
            m = int(a) * int(b)
            print(“Mult: ", m)
        return “Result = " + str(m)


    a = input("Enter a: ");
    b = input("Enter b: ");
    print(compute(a, b))

- Ex. 4. Consider the case when the user types a
non-numeric input.
Hint:
import sys
try:
    a = int(input("Enter a: "));
    b = float(input("Enter b: "));
except:
    print("Error, please enter numeric input")
    sys.exit(1) #to end the program

- Ex. 5. Write a program where the game Cows and Bulls is
played and a user can quit when he/she types exit. At the end
the total number of trials is shown and the average number of
succes.
Bulls: number of digits which are correctly placed
    1 2 3 4
    1 3 2 4
    2 bulls
    2 cows

- Ex. 6. Consider the case when you also want to know how
much time that person spent until he/she did guess the
number.
- Hint:
import time
start = time.time()
print("Let’s enjoy coding")
end = time.time()
print(end - start)

- Ex. 7. Consider reading from a file and printing the whole
text in uppercase in a separate file.
